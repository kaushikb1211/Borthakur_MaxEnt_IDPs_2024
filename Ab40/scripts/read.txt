Jupyter notebooks with examples for reweighting, analysing and plotting ensemble comparisons for three forcefields
STEP 1: Run the reweight.ipynb notebook for any forcefield - perform reweighting, generate weights, plot experimental vs MD simulation fit
STEP 2: Run the analysis.ipynb notebook for any forcefield - plot relevant analysis of the reweighting proecedure
STEP 3: Run the ensemble.ipynb notebook for any forcefield - calculate and plot relevant ensemble properties (Rg, secondary strctures, residue contacts etc)
